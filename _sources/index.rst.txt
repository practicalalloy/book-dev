Practical Alloy
==============================================

A hands-on guide to formal software design
------------------------------------------

This book is an introduction to formal software specification and analysis with `Alloy 6 <https://alloytools.org>`_. In this (latest) version, Alloy already allows the specification of behavioural designs with mutable relations and temporal logic, an extension previously implemented in `Electrum <http://haslab.github.io/Electrum/>`_.
