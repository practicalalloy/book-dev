How to read this book
========================

This book is organized in two parts, the first introducing the basics of modeling with Alloy, and the second exploring its application in the formal design of different kinds of software systems. 

The part about the basics is divided in two chapters, one about :ref:`structural-modeling` and the other about :ref:`behavioral-modeling`, each illustrated with a simple case study. If you want to get a quick introduction to Alloy you can just read these two chapters. If you want to know a bit more, then you can read the advanced topics that complement them. Each of these advanced topics builds on the case study of the respective main chapter, and each can be read separately in any order at your own pace. You can also interleave the reading of the main chapters and the advanced topics. 

The part about formal design applications will have a chapter for each application domain. For example, we currently already have a chapter about :ref:`protocol-design`, where we present idioms and tips to help you model and analyze distributed software, such as suggestions on how to model message passing. In the future we intend to add more chapters covering different application domains, for example we will soon add a chapter about how to use Alloy to design apps using Daniel Jackson's concepts [JAC21]_. Since these are more advanced chapters, we assume the reader already read before both chapters in the basics part, as well as some of the advanced topics. The required advanced topics will be listed at the beginning of each application chapter.

How to leave feedback
========================

The book has a comment system that allows you to leave comments or suggestions for each chapter and each advanced topic. This comment system requires you to have a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account and they will appear as issues in the public book repository.


Where to find the examples
==========================

All the examples in this book are available in a `public GitHub repository <https://github.com/practicalalloy/models>`_. This repository has a directory for each chapter (or advanced topic) in the book containing the example models at that chapter. In each chapter we will also include direct links to the respective directory in this repository. The themes that were used to customize the visualization of instances are also provided in the repository. Since running a command may result in different instances depending on the configuration, we also provide in this repository the exact command that generates the shown instance. These can be accessed by clicking on the instance figures along the book.

`Alcino Cunha <https://alcinocunha.github.io>`_ is an Associate Professor at the University of Minho and also member of the High-Assurance Software Laboratory of INESC TEC. His research aims to make formal software design more accessible for all software engineers. Together with the other authors of this book, he developed the new version 6 of Alloy, as well as several other extensions. He was also involved in the development of `Alloy4Fun <http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt>`_, a web application for sharing and learning Alloy. In the past 15 years he has taught many courses about Alloy, mainly to master students at University of Minho, but also to researchers at summer schools and conferences, and practitioners in industry.

`Nuno Macedo <https://nmacedo.github.io/>`_ is an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto and a member of the High-Assurance Software Laboratory of INESC TEC. He has a long experience on researching lightweight formal software development methods, having developed several extensions to Alloy and its Analyzer, often in collaboration with other authors of this book, and is one of the main developers of the current Alloy Analyzer. He has been teaching Alloy at the graduate level for several years, and is one of the developers of the `Alloy4Fun <http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt>`_ platform for learning Alloy. He has also applied Alloy in knowledge transfer projects.
